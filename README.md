the code is not so optimal and responsive that s because we still didin't check out a the tools to do
so. So, this app may not look exactly the same in your emulator but that s not a problem for now focus
on the widgets themselves and make sure to read the comments found in many parts of the code to help
u more understand it. If u have any other questions, please make sure to contact
