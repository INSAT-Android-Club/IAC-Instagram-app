### What we did :

- Like / dislike button with setState 
- Async functions 
- Routing 



### What we will do: 
- Access to database with firEbase 
- Authentification 



        This code is may not be optimal or responsive that's because we still didin't check out tools to do that. 
        So, this app may not look exactly the same in your emulator 
        but hat's not a problem for now focuson the widgets themselves and make sure to read the comments 
        found in many parts of the code to help you understand.
